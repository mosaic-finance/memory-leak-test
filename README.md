# Leaky Store
This is a simple application to put fixing memory leaks to the test in a "stable" environment.

## Running
To run this application simply run `npm start`


## The process
If you would like to do this example I recommend doing the following.

1. Create a branch off of this one something similar to `bugfix/{nameprefix}-memory-fixes` would work (ex: `bugfix/jr-memory-fixes`)
2. Start the application and find the memory leaks.
3. Fix the memory leaks in the best way you know how.
4. Open a PR to see if you found all the leaks.
